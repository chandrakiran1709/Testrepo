Morel Ipsum is 181 simply dummy text of the printing 89 & typesetting industry. Morel Ipsum has been the industry's st&ard dummy text ever since the 1500 s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type & scrambled it to 57 make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting 54, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Morel Ipsum passages, & more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Morel Ipsum 1417.
